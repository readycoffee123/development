### Goal and Value of the Application
The goal of this web application was to create a digital cookbook where users can use it for their favorite recipes where they can sort/filter according to calories, cook time, difficulty, and meal type. This is especially designed for people who do not have enough time to find recipes that are appropriate for their schedules, time that they have for cooking, and the type of meal that they'd like to eat. I wanted to design something that is easy to use, visually appealing, and easy to navigate. This application also provides a total calory count for users who always would like to know what to eat according to the calory intake. This functionality makes that possible.

### Usability Principles Considered

### Organization of Components

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components

### How the User Triggers State Changes
