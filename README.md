### Goal and Value of the Application
The goal of this web application was to create a digital cookbook where users can use it for their favorite recipes where they can sort/filter according to calories, cook time, difficulty, and meal type. This is especially designed for people who do not have enough time to find recipes that are appropriate for their schedules, time that they have for cooking, and the type of meal that they'd like to eat. I wanted to design something that is easy to use, visually appealing, and easy to navigate. This application also provides a total calorie count for users who are curious about what they're eating and how much to eat more for a healthy calorie amount

### Usability Principles Considered
This web application considers the best and most optimal sorting and filtering options that the users might benefit from. These include cooktime to make sure that the recipe that the user wants is suitable for the amount of time that they can spare, calorie information to make sure that the user is getting enough and sufficient calories and nutrients, filtering by meal type to enable the users to find the recipe that they would like, and a "favorites" section where users can add the meals or drinks they like to refer back to and see their calorie information, if they'd like to.
